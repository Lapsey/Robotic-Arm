# Robotic-Arm
This is the code for Servo control (Arduino) and the computer interface (written in processing)

To use this code with your 4 servo robotic arm, upload the arduino sketch to your arduino with the servos attached to the following pins
  - X servo to pin 2
  - Y Lower servo to pin 3
  - Y Upper servo to pin 4
  - Gripper servo to pin 5
